# DolphinVintage

## Project Idea:

This app will be an online store for used vintage high end furniture. Why pay top dollar for new high end furniture when you can get the same thing for a fraction of the price slightly used. Here all transactions are secure and verified using Paypalâ€™s built in services. Surprise your wife with a stylish 1950s set of chairs. Gift a friend a really cool side table. This can all be done on DolphinVintage.com.
